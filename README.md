#### Description

This nRF52832 Dev Board is based on a well designed nRF52832 BLE module (E73). We’ve flashed Adafruit’s nrf52 Arduino bootloader for you, which makes it compatible with Arduino IDE. The dev board is open source hardware, for any makers and engineers they can embed the nRF52832 module into their project once the prototype is verified. 

The board breakouts all the pins from the module, and the pins for the NRF antenna. There is one NFC antenna with the package, which can be easily soldered to the through holes. 

We also added two Qwiic connectors, so you can use our Qwiic modules to instantly start I2C projects.

For the main IC nRF52832, you can check it from Nordic official website [here](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Low-power-short-range-wireless/nRF52832). 


> Note: the Pins are not pre-soldered.
